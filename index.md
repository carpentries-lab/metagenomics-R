> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. 
> However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
> including how a DNA sequence looks like. Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. 
>
> This lesson is part of a workshop that uses data hosted on an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). Workshop participants will be given 
> information on how
> to log-in to the AMI during the workshop. Learners using these materials for self-directed study will need to set up their own
> AMI. Information on setting up an AMI and accessing the required data is provided on the [Metagenomics Workshop Setup page](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/metagenomics-workshop/setup.html).
